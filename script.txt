Banka: I think Jay here did it with his "cooking" skills ðŸ˜‚
Jay: It exploded! [MEME] shocked cat
Khooi: OMG THAT'S SO BAD Banka what did you do? 
Jay: Not me, Khooi! I swear I just set the timer
Banka: Yeah, don't believe him. He's always trying to frame others ðŸ¤£
Manyi: Wait, which timer? There wasn't one in the recipe
Jay: I did use a timer... on my phone ðŸ“±
